//It really depends on the amount of duplicated data. Could be useful for shared memories.
//Create different node types? People Nodes, Item Nodes, Event (Shared) Nodes. Cue Nodes (Single direction entry point nodes)
//See if it is worth while doing that, or if it provides no benefit just just general nodes.
